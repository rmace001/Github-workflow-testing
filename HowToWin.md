# How to Win

It should be easy to understand how to win.

## What to Do

What do you need to do to win? AKA, how can you impress your future self?

### The Process of Inversion

`Inversion`: The cognitive process of identifying and addressing problems or threats to ensure survival.

Many of us already know how to win, simply because we know how to lose. We have much stronger problem-finding skills than solution finding. Let's use our anxiety-driven, threat-finding brain... for something good.

### Inversion Exercise

1. Imagine the least successful version of yourself. What does that person do (or not do), to guarantee a failure to win?
   - Impatience
   - Not wait for my turn to speak
   - Showing up late
   - Unprepared
   - not confident
   - not fully present
   - transactional not relational
   - doesn't follow up
   - doesn't adverstise
   - doesn't ask for referrals
   - Doesn't Act in a way that I am proud of
   - Don't keep my self respect
   - Doesn't Act in line with my values
   - Doesn't Maintain good relationships
   - Not being clear
   - Not being stable
   - Not being assertive
   - Not knowing my values and goals
   - Doesn't validate
   - Doesn' listen and ask questions
   - Doesn't remain calm
   - Not ensure my message is clear
   - Not Be assertive about my feelings, wants, needs, values, boundaries
   - Only focus on what's NOT in my control
   - Not exercise the STOP skill if emotions run high
   - Not counterbalance red flags with green flags
   - Take things personal
   - Not Understand that we are all human and that this is probably difficult for everyone
   - Not emphasize the focus on the green flags
2. How do we use these things that our brains came up with, to win? WE INVERT THEM.

   - Not wait for my turn to speak -> Wait for my turn to speak

   - Be assertive about my feelings, wants, needs, values, boundaries
   - Only focus on what's in my control

## How to Do It

Most times we don't do things because we haven't broken them down to their most basic form.

The more skilled you are, the more general a command can be and you can follow it. (Ex: "Go eliminate all incorrect usage of 'feature A'.", "Go advertise.", "Build an online store for my products.", etc.). Thus, the less skilled you are, the more broken-down the command must be in order for you to follow it.
